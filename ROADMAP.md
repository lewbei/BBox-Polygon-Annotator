# Project Roadmap: BBox & Polygon Annotator
*Private Research Tool Development Roadmap*

This document outlines the development roadmap for the BBox & Polygon Annotator - a **private research tool designed specifically for solo researchers and individual computer vision projects**.

**Important**: This is a private research tool. Development priorities focus on solo researcher needs, not enterprise or collaborative features.

## I. Current Status (as of June 2025)

The application (v10+) is a **mature, feature-complete annotation tool** specifically optimized for solo research use:
- **Complete Dual Annotation**: Full bounding box & polygon support with advanced editing
- **Solo-Friendly Project Manager**: Lightweight project management perfect for individual research workflows
- **AI-Powered Research Workflow**: YOLO auto-annotation designed for rapid dataset creation
- **Research-Standard Exports**: 5 export formats (YOLO YAML, COCO JSON, Pascal VOC XML, CSV, Generic JSON)
- **Researcher-Focused UX**: Simple, intuitive interface designed for researchers who want to focus on data, not tools
- **Private & Secure**: Runs entirely locally with no cloud dependencies or data sharing concerns
- **Research-Ready Architecture**: Robust error handling, logging, and data protection features

## II. Vision: Perfect Tool for Solo Computer Vision Research
